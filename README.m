#Compressor_Decompressor

The provided code consists of two Java classes: Compressor and Decompressor. Together, they form a basic file compression and decompression system. Here's a summary of the project:

Compressor class:

Contains a method compressFile() that takes a File object as input and compresses it using GZIP compression.
It reads the contents of the input file using FileInputStream and writes the compressed data to a new file with the ".gz" extension using GZIPOutputStream.
The compressed file is stored in the same directory as the original file.

Decompressor class:

Contains a method decompressFile() that takes a File object as input and decompresses it from GZIP format.
It reads the compressed file using FileInputStream and decompresses the data using GZIPInputStream.
The decompressed data is written to a new file without any specific extension in the same directory as the compressed file.
The project provides a basic framework for compressing and decompressing files using GZIP compression in Java. However, it should be noted that these classes alone do not constitute a complete file compression and decompression system. Additional functionality, such as file selection, error handling, and user interface, would likely be required to create a fully functional application or library for file compression and decompression.
