# Compressor_Decompressor

The provided code is a Java class named Decompressor that contains a method decompressFile() for decompressing a GZIP-compressed file. This code is intended to be part of a larger project related to file compression and decompression.

Here's a summary of the code:

The Decompressor class defines a single static method decompressFile() that takes a File object as a parameter. The method throws an IOException if there's an error during the decompression process.

The method retrieves the parent directory of the input file using file.getParent() to determine where the decompressed file will be stored.

It creates a FileInputStream to read the contents of the compressed file (file), and a GZIPInputStream to decompress the data from the input stream.

A FileOutputStream is created to write the decompressed data to a new file named "DecompressedFile" in the same directory as the original compressed file.

The method reads the compressed data from the GZIPInputStream in chunks (buffer) and writes the decompressed data to the output stream (fos).

Once the decompression is complete, the method closes the GZIPInputStream, FileOutputStream, and FileInputStream to release the resources.

This code provides a basic implementation for decompressing GZIP-compressed files in Java. However, it is important to note that this class alone does not constitute a complete project. It is likely that this class would be used in conjunction with other classes and functionality to create a comprehensive file compression and decompression system.

The provided code consists of two Java classes: Compressor and Decompressor. Together, they form a basic file compression and decompression system. Here's a summary of the project:

Compressor class:

Contains a method compressFile() that takes a File object as input and compresses it using GZIP compression.
It reads the contents of the input file using FileInputStream and writes the compressed data to a new file with the ".gz" extension using GZIPOutputStream.
The compressed file is stored in the same directory as the original file.
Decompressor class:

Contains a method decompressFile() that takes a File object as input and decompresses it from GZIP format.
It reads the compressed file using FileInputStream and decompresses the data using GZIPInputStream.
The decompressed data is written to a new file without any specific extension in the same directory as the compressed file.
The project provides a basic framework for compressing and decompressing files using GZIP compression in Java. However, it should be noted that these classes alone do not constitute a complete file compression and decompression system. Additional functionality, such as file selection, error handling, and user interface, would likely be required to create a fully functional application or library for file compression and decompression.
